# PythonAlgorithms

A collection of algorithms from Freecodecamp (originally written in Javascript) that were re-written in Python for practice. 

Some functions include:
-String reversal
-Array (list) splitting 
-Spinal tap casing

...as well as a few extras that weren't on the website, such as bubble sort and insertion sort. All of the code is original.
